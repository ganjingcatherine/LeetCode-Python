### Problem
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
### Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        startIdx, curGas, total = 0, 0, 0
        for i in xrange(len(gas)):
            curGas += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if curGas < 0:
                startIdx = i + 1
                total += curGas
                curGas = 0
        total += curGas
        return -1 if total < 0 else startIdx
                
```
