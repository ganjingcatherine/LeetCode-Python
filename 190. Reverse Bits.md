### Problem
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
<pre>
For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).

Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
</pre>
### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    # @param n, an integer
    # @return an integer
    def reverseBits(self, n):
        res = 0
        for i in xrange(32):
            res = res << 1
            digit = n & 1
            n = n >> 1
            res += digit
            
        return res
        
```
