### Problem
Given a binary tree

    struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
<pre>
Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
For example,
Given the following perfect binary tree,
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \  / \
    4  5  6  7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    4->5->6->7 -> NULL
</pre>
### Solution
```python
# Definition for binary tree with next pointer.
# class TreeLinkNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param root, a tree link node
    # @return nothing
    def connect(self, root):
        
        if root is None:
            return 
        
        if root.right is None and root.left is None:
            return
        
        root.left.next = root.right
        if root.next is not None:
            root.right.next = root.next.left
        
        self.connect(root.left)
        self.connect(root.right)
            
        
```
