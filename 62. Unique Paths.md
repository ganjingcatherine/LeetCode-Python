#####Problem
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


#####Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        if m < 1 or n < 1: 
            return 1
        
        board = [[0] * n for i in xrange(m)]
        for i in xrange(m):
            for j in xrange(n):
                if i == 0:
                    board[i][j] = 1
                elif j == 0:
                    board[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    board[i][j] = board[i - 1][j] + board[i][j - 1]
        return board[m - 1][n -1]
```
