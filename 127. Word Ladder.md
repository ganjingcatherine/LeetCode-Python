### Problem
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
<pre>
For example,

Given:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Note:
Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
</pre>
### Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord, endWord, wordList):
        """
        :type beginWord: str
        :type endWord: str
        :type wordList: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        if len(wordList) == 0 or endWord not in wordList:
            return 0
        
        res = 0
        qu, hashSet = collections.deque(), set()
        qu.append(beginWord)
        wordSet = set(wordList)
        
        while len(qu) != 0:
            res += 1
            size = len(qu)
            for i in xrange(size):
                s = qu.popleft()
                if s in hashSet:
                    continue
                if s == endWord:
                    return res
                
                hashSet.add(s)
                candicates = self.buildNextStr(s, wordSet)
                for nextS in candicates:
                    qu.append(nextS)
        return 0
    
    def buildNextStr(self, s, wordSet):
        
        res = []
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            for j in xrange(26):
                ch = chr(ord('a') + j)
                if s[i] == ch:
                    continue
                
                newS = s[:i] + ch + s[i + 1:]
                if newS in wordSet:
                    res.append(newS)
                    wordSet.remove(newS)
        return res
        
```
