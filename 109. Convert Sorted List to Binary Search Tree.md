### Problem
Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
<pre>
Example:

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
</pre>
### Solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def sortedListToBST(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        return self.buildBST(head, None)
        
    def buildBST(self, head, end):
        if head == end:
            return None
        
        mid = self.findMid(head, end)
        root = TreeNode(mid.val)
        root.left = self.buildBST(head, mid)
        root.right = self.buildBST(mid.next, end)
        return root
        
    
    def findMid(self, head, end):
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast != end and fast.next!= end:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next       
        return slow
```
