### Problem
Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?
<pre>
Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
For example,
Given the following binary tree,
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
</pre>
### Solution
```python
# Definition for binary tree with next pointer.
# class TreeLinkNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param root, a tree link node
    # @return nothing
    def connect(self, root):
        while root:
            child = dummy = TreeLinkNode(0)
            while root:
                child.next = root.left
                child = child.next or child
                child.next = root.right
                child = child.next or child
                root = root.next
            root = dummy.next
            
```
