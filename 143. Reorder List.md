### Problem
Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

You must do this in-place without altering the nodes' values.
<pre>
For example,
Given {1,2,3,4}, reorder it to {1,4,2,3}.
</pre>
### Solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def reorderList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return
        
        # break the list, and reverse the right part
        left = right = head
        while right is not None and right.next is not None:
            left, right = left.next, right.next.next
        
        prev, cur, left.next = None, left.next, None
        left, right = head, None
        
        while cur is not None:
            right = cur
            tmp = cur.next
            cur.next = prev
            prev, cur = cur, tmp
        
        
        
        # merge the 2 lists
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        cur = dummy
        while left is not None and right is not None:
            cur.next = left
            left = left.next
            cur = cur.next
            
            cur.next = right
            right = right.next
            cur = cur.next
        
        if left is not None:
            cur.next = left
        
        if right is not None:
            cur.next = right
        
```
