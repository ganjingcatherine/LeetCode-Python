### Problem
The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.
### Solution
```python
# The read4 API is already defined for you.
# @param buf, a list of characters
# @return an integer
# def read4(buf):

class Solution(object):
    def read(self, buf, n):
        """
        :type buf: Destination buffer (List[str])
        :type n: Maximum number of characters to read (int)
        :rtype: The number of characters read (int)
        """

        idx = 0
        
        while n > 0:
            buff = [""] * 4
            readBytes = read4(buff)
            if readBytes == 0:
                return idx
            
            for i in xrange(min(n, readBytes)):
                buf[idx] = buff[i]
                idx += 1
                n -= 1
        return idx

```
