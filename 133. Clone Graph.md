### Problem
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
<pre>
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
</pre>
### Solution
```python
# Definition for a undirected graph node
# class UndirectedGraphNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.label = x
#         self.neighbors = []

class Solution:
    # @param node, a undirected graph node
    # @return a undirected graph node
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        qu, hashMap = collections.deque(), dict()
        if node is None:
            return None
        
        qu.append(node)
        while len(qu) != 0:
            n = qu.popleft()
            cloneNode = hashMap.setdefault(n, UndirectedGraphNode(n.label))
            nbs = n.neighbors
            
            for nb in nbs:
                if nb not in hashMap:
                    qu.append(nb)
                
                cloneNbNode = hashMap.setdefault(nb, UndirectedGraphNode(nb.label))
                cloneNode.neighbors.append(cloneNbNode)
                    
        
        return hashMap[node]
            
        
```
