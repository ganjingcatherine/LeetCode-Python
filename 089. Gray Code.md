### Problem
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
<pre>
For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.
For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

### Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def grayCode(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
        res = [0]
        for i in xrange(n):
            res += [x + 2 ** i for x in reversed(res)]
        return res
```
