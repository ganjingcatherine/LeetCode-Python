### Problem
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

<pre>
Example 1:
[[1,3,1],
 [1,5,1],
 [4,2,1]]
Given the above grid map, return 7. Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        preRow, curRow = [0] * n, [0] * n
        
        for i in xrange(m):
            for j in xrange(n):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    curRow[j] = grid[i][j]
                    continue
    
                if i == 0:
                    curRow[j] = grid[i][j] + curRow[j - 1]
                    continue
                
                if j == 0:
                    curRow[j] = preRow[j] + grid[i][j]
                    continue
                curRow[j] = min(preRow[j], curRow[j - 1]) + grid[i][j]
            tmp = preRow
            preRow = curRow
            curRow = tmp
        return preRow[-1]
```
