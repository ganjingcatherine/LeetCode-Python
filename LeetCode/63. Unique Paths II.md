#####Problem

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

<pre>
For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
The total number of unique paths is 2.
Note: m and n will be at most 100.
</pre>

#####Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        board = [[0] * n for i in xrange(m)]
        board[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0
        
        if board[0][0] == 0:
            return 0
        
        for i in xrange(m):
            for j in xrange(n):
                if i == 0 and j == 0 or obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    continue
                left = 0 if j == 0 or obstacleGrid[i][j - 1] == 1 else board[i][j - 1]
                up = 0 if i == 0 or obstacleGrid[i - 1][j] == 1 else board[i - 1][j]
                board[i][j] = up + left
        
        return board[m - 1][n - 1]
```
