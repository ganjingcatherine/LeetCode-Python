### Problem
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
<pre>
For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
</pre>
### Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type wordDict: List[str]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        words = set(wordDict)
        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        
        for i in xrange(1, len(s) + 1):
            for j in xrange(0, i):
                if dp[j] and (s[j:i] in words):
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        return dp[-1]
```
