### Problem
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
### Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        candies, candies2, res = [0] * len(ratings), [0] * len(ratings), 0
        for i in xrange(len(ratings)):
            if i == 0 or ratings[i] <= ratings[i - 1]:
                candies[i] += 1
            else:
                candies[i] += candies[i - 1] + 1
        
        for i in xrange(len(ratings) - 1, -1, -1):
            if i == len(ratings) - 1 or ratings[i] <= ratings[i + 1]:
                candies2[i] += 1
            else:
                candies2[i] += candies2[i + 1] + 1
        
        for i in xrange(len(candies)):
            res += max(candies[i], candies2[i])
        return res
        
```
