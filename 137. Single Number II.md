### Problem

<pre>
Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        ans = 0
        for i in xrange(32):
            bitSum = 0
            for n in nums:
                bitSum += (n>>i) & 1
            
            bitSum %= 3
            if bitSum == 1:
                ans = ans | bitSum<<i
        if ans >= 2**31:
            ans -= 2**32
        return ans
    
```
